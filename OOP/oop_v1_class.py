# class as a blueprint (like a recipe or a template)
# object has a state and behaviors.
# object is an instance of a class
# define a class first to create an object from it
# from the class, you can create one or more objects.
# To create an object from the Person class, use the class name followed by parentheses (), like calling a function
# person = Person() the 'person' is an instance of the 'Person' class.
# Object / Instance: When you use the class to make something, you create an instance (an actual object).
# A class is a template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.
# Attributes are the data that belong to the object. 
# Methods are the actions that the object can perform.
# Methods are functions inside the class that objects can use.
# analogy: class as blueprint → object as product → attributes as features/properties → methods as actions)
