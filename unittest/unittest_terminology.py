The idea of unit testing is to check each small piece of your program 
to ensure it works properly

# System under test is a function, a class, a method that will be tested.
# Test case class (unittest.TestCase): is the base class for all the test classes.
# Test fixtures are methods that execute before and after a test method executes.
# Assertions are methods that check the behavior of the component being tested.
# Test suite is a group of related tests executed together.
# Test runner is a program that runs the test suite.
